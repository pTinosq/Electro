# Contributing to Electro

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Electro! This project is designed to be a great place for developers of all skill levels to get involved, whether you are just starting out or an experienced contributor.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository** â€“ Click the 'Fork' button on the Electro repository to create your own copy.
2. **Clone Your Fork** â€“ Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Electro.git
   ```

3. **Set Upstream Remote** â€“ Add the original Electro repository as an upstream remote:

   ```sh
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ElectroOrg/Electro.git
   ```

4. **Create a Branch** â€“ Work on your changes in a feature branch:

   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Branching Strategy

Electro follows a structured branching model to ensure stability across different versions:

- **`main`** â€“ The production branch containing stable, tested releases.
- **`beta`** â€“ The pre-release branch for features that have been sufficiently tested in `dev`.
- **`dev`** â€“ The active development branch where all changes are initially merged. Once changes are tested and stable, they move to `beta`. When `beta` is confirmed to be issue-free, it gets merged into `main`.

### Where to Target Your PR

- All changes should be based on `dev`.
- Once tested and confirmed stable, changes from `dev` will be merged into `beta`.
- `main` only receives changes after they have been verified in `beta`.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Ensure Your Code is Up-to-Date**

   ```sh
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout dev
   git merge upstream/dev
   ```

2. **Commit Your Changes**

   ```sh
   git commit -m "Add feature: description here"
   ```

3. **Push Your Changes**

   ```sh
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Open a Pull Request** â€“ Navigate to the Electro repository, and open a pull request against `dev`.

## Code Guidelines
